The Space Marine light-scout workhorse, the Yangrel-pattern Combat Motor-Bike is capable of putting out a quick speed of over 60 KPH off-road while remaining well armoured.
Mounted on its fore-shield, is a coaxial pair of .75 calibre Bolters fed with an internal non-discintigrating link feed.
It is capable of a slightly slower rate of fire compared to the heavier storm-bolter.
