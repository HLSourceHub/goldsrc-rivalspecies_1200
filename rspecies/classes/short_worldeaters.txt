The World Eaters are a traitor legion that follows khorne, the blood god and are fierce close combat figthers.
They are Terrifying and unrelenting warriors, whose only need is to spill blood for their infernal master.
Their Primarch is Angron, the savage primarch who led them in Rebellion during the Horus Heresy.
The World Eaters are the bane of the galaxy.
