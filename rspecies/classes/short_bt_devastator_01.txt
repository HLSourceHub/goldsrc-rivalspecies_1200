Space Marines are the Imperium's finest warriors. Their Chapters have defended mankind for ten thousand years since the Emperor's Great Crusade. Genetically enhanced, defended by power armour and well equipped, few can oppose them.

Space Marine Sergeants lead squads of up to ten Marines. They provide tactical close combat support and have access the the Chapter's rarer wargear, such as power weapons.
