The Warboss is the most orky of orks, larger, stronger, tougher and more aggresive than any other ork in the tribe, they bully, bribe and use orky charisma to lead they fellow orks. The warboss gets first pick of gear, making him the best armed of all the orks.

 Only one member of each team can be a Leader! Leaders are very tough and powerful warriors, but have very few (usually only one) spawn. Warbosses are the only Orks that have access to Mega Armor, Power Claws and Big Shoota.
