-The custom textures featured in this map is made by ChromAngel, SPAWN and 2 of them by myself. The rest are either made by Valve
or can be found in one of the wads that are released with RS. Some made specially by me for this map any texture starting with
!ko_ or ko may not be used in another map without my premission. Thanks to Alhaus for inspiration to the maps story.

-This map is made for RS and may not be used in any other mod/game without premission from me.
